        <p>I really don't know na solla poradhu la ethana unaku pudhusa irukum nu, I always want to make valentine's day special for you. Everyday is valentine's day but, today is special. My dearest gundu, every moment with you is Precious. Even though we are in long distance, my heart is always with you. Unaku kandipa nyabagam irukadha, but Namma first valentine day appo dhan Namma sanda potu reunite aanom 🤧. Honestly, it sucks. I'm literally so deeply in love with you that I don't even find other girls attractive anymore. Like, I just want you and I mean that in every possible way. Physically, emotionally, mentally - you're all I fucking want. And I can't imagine being with anyone else, thinking about anyone else or loving anyone else. You're it for me 😘.
I don't know how many promises I've kept, how good of a boyfriend I am, green flag or a red flag I don't know, all I know is that I love you and I'll do each and everything possible to keep you happy. Eppovume andha smile venum enaku, myyy azhagiyeeee 🥺. when you yap, you'll always have me as your listener ❤️.I really try writing poems just to make you more happy, make you feel my love. Because I try to be poetic in the way that I love you, but it is so passionate I cannot string words together in any way that makes sense. Whatever happens, I'll always be there for you, for us. I promise to never let any tears from your honey brown eyes, keep you safe always ❤️. I always have my warm hugs open for you, and of course my kisses too. 3 years down now, forever to go my wifeyy. Be my valentine forever, oke?
I love you more than words can ever say 💋</p>

        <p class="hidden-message" id="secretMessage" style="display:none;"Hey Wifey,

I wanted to send you a special message, just for us, because you deserve to know how much I adore you. I still remember the first time I got the courage to sing BAE song in front of the class. The way I couldn't take my eyes off you, even though everyone could sense something between us. It was like the world faded away, and it was just you and me, right from the start.

I love how we’ve grown together, even through all the little arguments. Every moment with you is worth more than anything else. You’re the reason I always want to be better, because, Harshadha, you make me feel like I can conquer anything.

I know we’re both shy, but I’m so ready to take that first step when we finally get to make it happen. I can’t wait for that moment where everything aligns—where I get to kiss you for real and show you how much you mean to me. And don't worry, when we do, you’ll hear my heartbeat loud and clear, just for you.

Every time we talk, it’s like you’re reading my heart, and honestly, I feel like the luckiest person in the world to have you by my side. You’re my rare gem, and I know we’re meant to keep building something special together. So here’s to our future, filled with more songs, kisses, hugs, and everything that makes us, us.

I love you so much, Wifey. Let’s keep making memories and turning them into our beautiful reality. You’re the best thing in my life, and I wouldn’t trade you for anything.

Forever yours,
Husband 💖</p>
